Pontos que posso falar sobre além de CDI com Seam 3

Nesta palestra discutiremos algumas questões inerentes à avaliação do Seam 3 aplicado em sistemas que usam JSF2 e CDI. 
Primeiramente, veremos em linhas gerais o propósito do CDI e sua implementação referência Weld, os problemas que ele se propôs a solucionar. 
Em seguida discutiremos sobre a nova versão da especificação JSF, considerando-os como principais ferramentas para 
desenvolvimento de aplicações Web. Debateremos ainda sobre as dificuldades arquiteturais encontradas no seu uso: 
falta de gerenciamento de transações (IoC), transação demarcardas X transação por request, testabilidade e problemas 
básicos ainda encontrados no JSF2. Portanto, serão descritos três módulos do projeto Seam 3: Persitence, Solder e Faces.
Finalmente concluiremos com alguns exemplos práticos utilizando a ferramenta para aprofundamento do conhecimento dos 
problemas elicitados e uma breve discussão sobre futuros módulos discutidos na lista interna dos desenvolvedores como 
o Seam Reports, Seam Cache e Seam Social.

Conversation Problems -

The problem was the spec, from what I've understood they couldn't all agree on how to treat some of the features 
from Seam 2. Currently you can only have one conversation going at a time per session, and there is no nesting of 
conversations. I believe the Seam Conversation module though address many of these issues.

			In retrospective, I do not regret this decision, but I had to spend a significant amount of time analyzing and debugging platform problems. 
			Based on this experience with Java EE 6, which may not be representative of course, the only advice I can give is: When Java EE 7 is released, 
			wait a year or two before using it for production, unless you have the time and resources to act as beta tester.
			The Java EE 6 specifications were released in December 2009, together with Glassfish v3, the first "production-quality release" of a Java EE 6 server. 
			"Marketing release" would have been more appropriate, since going by the number of bugs in Glassfish 3.0, the main driving factor for the release date 
			was quite obviously not a quality benchmark, but simply the need for Sun as the Java EE champion to release a working server simultaneously with the 
			specifications.
			
			
			However, for my project, CDI in the guise of Weld, its reference implementation, turned out to be the largest single source of problems. 
			In addition to a number of functional bugs where injection would not work in certain scenarios, there are at least two severe memory issues:
				- Weld causes memory leaks on application redeployment.
					https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=12368
				- Even in the first deployment of an application, Weld uses enormous amounts of memory.
			
			The test was made in windows e ubuntu
			
			
			WishList
			
			All in all, if you want to work with Java EE 6, there is currently no way around Weld. And until Weld reaches production quality, 
			the only way to build production quality applications on Java EE 6 is to avoid using CDI.

			Free and Open Source Software is all about choice - so I would really love to see a pluggable CDI provider interface that would 
			allow users to work with Glassfish and some CDI implementation other than Weld.

			The second best solution might be to join forces from different CDI project to make Weld stable enough for production usage.

			The third option would be another fully Java EE 6 compliant Open Source server (maybe Geronimo?) not including Weld.

			No idea if any of these options is realistic, but this is on my wishlist for 2011.



	I'm glad to say we made a lot of progress! We saw improvements in memory usage, boot time and runtime performance. 
	Our measurements showed a two fold improvement in boot time with just a few beans in the deployment, but with many beans, 
	we were showing more than a 10 fold improvement. Memory usage had a consistent 4 fold improvement, regardless of the number of beans deployed. 
	There was a 40% improvement in runtime performance, and we saw that Weld performs as well as, or better than other CDI implementations available, 
	as well as other solutions in the DI space.
These improvements are all included in Weld 1.1.0 (which is included in JBoss AS 6 and GlassFish 3.1), and we do plan further improvements, 
especially around memory usage, with Weld 1.2 (which will be included in JBoss AS 7). The eventual aim is for Weld to use around 1k per bean.

	4 - Seam Persistence
		Problem 1: How to Save an Book?
		- I need an Entity Manager

				- problem 1: i need to implement this. I still have to manage my Transaction
				- problem 2:

					e se anotar uma classe??? até getter é chamado

		Problem 1: how to search for a book?
			- book.xhtml?id=3			
			- The complain - not bookmarkble
			
			JSF employs an event-oriented architecture. Listeners are invoked in response to user-interface events, 
			such as the user clicking on a button or changing the value of a form input. Unfortunately, the most important
			 event on the web, a URL request (initiated by the user clicking on a link, entering a URL into the browser's 
			 location bar or selecting a bookmark), has long been overlooked in JSF. Historically, listeners have exclusively 
			 been activated on postback, which has led to the common complaint that in JSF, "everything is a POST."
		
			- JSF2 :  Some GET support was added to JSF 2.0 with the introduction of view parameters 
			and the pre-render view event.	 			
			- I need more, rest/ friendly url: SEAM3/search/1
				viewAction - fazer redirect para livro nao encontrado, com jsf puro nao rola
		
		Problem 2: How to validate two fields at the same time?
			- password and confirm password -> they must be equal

			@Inject Messages
		
	6 - SeamSolder
		- Explicar que é dividida em 3 partes
		
			Seam Solder is a library of Generally Useful Stuff (tm), particularly if you are developing an application 
			based on CDI (JSR-299 Java Contexts and Dependency Injection), or a CDI based library or framework.

			@Veto
			@Requires
			@Exact - alternativa para os qualifiers
			@Named no package
			@FullyQualifiedNamed

		Problem 1: How to get a file?
		
			@Resource
			ServletLifecycle.getServletContext().getRealPath("xml/atividades.xml");
			X
			Como testar isso????? mocar! mas como moco? manipulação de bytecode… powermockito
			@Inject
			@Resource("WEB-INF/web.xml")
			InputStream webXml

		CDI - 1.1
 			- Problemas que ja sabiam mas nao tiveram tempo para consertar e os unexpected issues
 			- stardilize extensions plugins that the community has build
			I will be leading the EG for CDI 1.1 - in fact I've just finished the first draft of the JSR proposal and am collecting feedback before it is made public. We feel that CDI 1.0 has had a very positive reception in the community, and that in general people are able to achieve what they need with the current functionality. However, there are a few minor rough spots; these fall into two categories - there are those that we knew about when we released CDI 1.0, but because we didn't have time to explore the correct solution left for a later date, and, of course, some unexpected issues. CDI 1.1 aims to address these rough spots, as well as to standardize a few of the most popular extensions the community has built. We don't plan to add any major new areas of functionality. A few of the things you can expect include:
			Global ordering of interceptors and decorators, as well as global enablement of alternatives
			An API for managing built in contexts, allowing the built in implementation of the conversation context to be used outside of JSF
			An embedded mode allowing startup outside of a Java EE container
			Bean declaration at constructor level
			Static injection
			Inclusion of @Unwraps from Seam Solder
			Numerous minor enhancements to the Portable Extensions SPI
			Client controlled contexts
			Better support for CDI in libraries when used in the Java EE platform
			Send CDI events for Servlet events
			Application lifecycle events

#seam-dev on irc.freenode.net - discussão sobre packing - 25/05

Seam Reports, Seam Cache, Seam Social

Hello,

I would like to propose a new module on Seam: Seam Cache.

That module would be JSR-107 compatible (essentially Infinispan and EhCache) and would allow to:

1) @Inject Cache cache;
2) Provide a new scope @CacheScoped(regionName="xx"). That would live for the time of the cache configured by the region name itself.

The module should be tested on Inifinispan and EhCache.

What do you guys think ?

Regards,

		Gavin King (Project Founder)
		Shane Bryzak (Project Lead)
		Pete Muir (former Project Lead)
		Dan Allen (Community Liaison)
